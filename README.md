# 🧭 Maze Memory Game — A Cognitive Task on Spatial Learning and Memory

This project is an **original 2D maze-based cognitive task** designed and implemented by **[Your Name]** to study **spatial memory, learning through exploration, and navigation planning**.  
The task was fully coded using **HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS**, and is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## 🧩 Task Overview

The experiment is designed as a **two-phase spatial memory task**:

1. **Encoding Phase (5 seconds):**  
   Participants view the **complete maze layout** and are asked to remember the pathway structure.

2. **Navigation Phase:**  
   The maze layout then disappears, and only the **player’s position** (👤) and the **goal location** (⭐) are visible.  
   Participants must **navigate to the goal** using the arrow keys, relying solely on memory of the maze.

Each step taken leaves a visible trace, allowing participants to **learn through trial and error** and gradually **form a cognitive map** of the maze structure.

## 🎯 Research Motivation

This task investigates:
- **Spatial working memory** — how individuals retain and manipulate spatial layouts after limited exposure.  
- **Learning through feedback** — how repeated exploration refines mental representations of space.  
- **Cognitive modeling** — using behavioral data to model latent learning processes and navigation strategies.

Potential modeling approaches include:
- Reinforcement learning models for path optimization  
- Bayesian or successor representation models of spatial inference

## 📚 Experimental Context

This task can serve as a prototype for experimental paradigms exploring:
- Human spatial navigation and memory consolidation  
- Learning under uncertainty and partial observability  
- Cognitive map formation and environmental encoding  
- Computational modeling of exploration-exploitation trade-offs
